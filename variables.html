			<h1>Variables and Mixens</h1>
			<p><strong>Variables</strong> &amp; <strong>Mixens</strong> are two of ways that {less} makes it faster and easier to develop and maintain your CSS styles.</p>
			<div class="know">
				<h1>What is a Variable</h1>
				<p>Variables store a CSS value. This value can then be used in numerous rules, and for different properties.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Variables are probably one of the most requested items in CSS, especially by front end designers who have a little experience with programming.</p>
			<p>If you've ever written CSS, you have probably had numerous selectors that used the same color, thickness, etc. And you probably know the pain of running into a situation where you had to find and modify each of those values when a design aspect was changed. With {less} variables, this becomes much easier.</p>
			<p>Consider the CSS code (expect over thousands of lines of code like this):</p>
			<pre>.class1 {
	background-color: #143352;
}
.class2 {
	background-color: #fff;
 	color: #143352;
}
.class3 {
	border: 1px solid #143352;
}</pre>
<p>In {less} we define a value that get's used over and over again. Such as:</p>
<pre>@color-base: #143352;
.class1 {
	background-color: @color-base;
}
.class2 {
	background-color: #fff;
 	color: @color-base;
}
.class3 {
	border: 1px solid @color-base;
} </pre>
<p>Now we just have to change one value in one place, and all of the values get updated.</p>
<h2>Mixens</h2>
<div class="know">
	<h1>Why Use a Mixen?</h1>
	<p>A mixen is good when several elements will repeat a design element. Like a border style, radius, etc.</p>
</div>
<p>Mixens are kind of like variables, expect instead of storing a value, it stores one or more properties and their values.</p>
<p>Mixens are in some ways more powerful, but also a little less flexible, because they combine both the property and the value. This is because it lets you embed a CSS rule in another rule.</p>
<p>This is great if you have a design element that gets repeated. However, it does require a bit more fore-thought to ensure that it will work for you.</p>
<p>Consider the following example with a border radius.</p>
<pre>.roundedborder {
	border-radius: 10px;
}

.nav a {
	.roundedborder;
	color: #FFF;
	background-color: #000;
}</pre>
